## Bio
Hi! This is Weipeng Jiang (降伟鹏). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cybersec.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). As a member of the Laboratory for Advanced Computing and Intelligent Security, I am being advised by Prof.[Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/cshen/home).
Additionally, I am also very fortunate to work closely with Prof.[Juan Zhai](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~juanzhai/?_gl=1*1qkfoiq*_gcl_au*MTIxNDA2NTU2MC4xNzAxNjE3NjUy*_ga*Nzg0NzEzNTg3LjE3MDE2MTc2NTQ.*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwNzk2MzE0OS4yNS4wLjE3MDc5NjMxNDkuMC4wLjA.) and Prof.[Shiqing Ma](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shiqingma/). 

My research interests encompass **Software Engineering for AI systems (SE4AI) and AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)**. Specifically, I am actively involved in the following topics:

* Effective and Efficient Auditing and Red Teaming for LLM Safety, Fairness, and Privacy.
* Assessment and Enhancement of LLM4Code Applications.
* Defect Testing and Analysis in Deep Learning Frameworks and Dependency Libraries.
