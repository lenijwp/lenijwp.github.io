* I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cybersec.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). As a member of the Laboratory for Advanced Computing and Intelligent Security, I am being advised by Prof.[Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/cshen/home).
Additionally, I am also very fortunate to work closely with Prof.[Juan Zhai](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~juanzhai/?_gl=1*1qkfoiq*_gcl_au*MTIxNDA2NTU2MC4xNzAxNjE3NjUy*_ga*Nzg0NzEzNTg3LjE3MDE2MTc2NTQ.*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwNzk2MzE0OS4yNS4wLjE3MDc5NjMxNDkuMC4wLjA.) and Prof.[Shiqing Ma](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shiqingma/). 

* My research interests are <b>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</b> and <b>Software Engineering for AI (SE4AI)</b>. More specifically, I am interested in:
    * Redteaming for large languague models (LLMs), covering privacy, safety and ethical concerns.
    * Fairness testing and debugging for AI-based decision-making systems.
    * Testing and Evaluation for LLM-driven SE Tools.
